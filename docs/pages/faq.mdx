# Frequently Asked Questions

This pages answers some of the most common questions asked in the
[support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-history/).

## How do I control what is logged?

> I believe Simple History is adding to much information to the log. Can I limit what is logged?

Yes, there are some **useful filters** you can use to control
what is being added to the log:

- [`simple_history/log/do_log`](/hooks#simple_history/log/do_log)
- [`simple_history/log/do_log/{$this->slug}/{$message_key}`](/hooks#simple_history/log/do_log/{$this->slug}/{$message_key})
- [`simple_history/log/do_log/{$this->slug}`](/hooks#simple_history/log/do_log/{$this->slug})

## Can I log when a user does something on my website, like visits a page?

Yes, using the [Logging API](/logging) you can add anything you want to the log.

Here are some examples:

```php
// Add a message to the log when a user visits a page on your site.
add_action( 'wp_footer', 'trackUserActivity' );
function trackUserActivity() {
  $user = wp_get_current_user();
  $user_email = $user->user_email;
  $page_title = get_the_title();
  $msg = "User $user_email viewed page $page_title";
  apply_filters( 'simple_history_log', $msg );
}
```

## Can the RSS feed show more than 10 items?

Yes, you can use the filter [`simple_history/rss_feed_args`](/hooks#simple_history/rss_feed_args)
to change how many items are included.

## Can the log be shown on the front of my website?

No, there is no built in support for displaying the log on the frontend of a website.

If you are a developer you can use the [SimpleHistoryLogQuery](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/main/inc/SimpleHistoryLogQuery.php)
class to query the log manually and display the results.

## How do I clear the log?

Items in the log are removed automatically after 60 days.

There's also a **"Clear log now"-button** on the _Settings_ -> _Simple History_ screen.
